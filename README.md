# üêç Snake Game on FPGA

This project implements the classic **Snake Game** entirely in hardware using an **FPGA**. Designed using **Verilog**, it showcases a hardware-level approach to game development by interfacing with a VGA display and including a custom-built **random number generator** for dynamic fruit placement.

## üöÄ Overview

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game in which the player controls a snake that grows longer as it consumes randomly placed fruits. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the game boundary.

In this hardware version:
- All game logic is implemented using **Verilog HDL**.
- A **custom random number generator** is used for fruit placement.
- **VGA output** allows the game to be displayed on a monitor in real time.
- The game is fully synthesized and deployed on an **FPGA development board**, such as the Xilinx Nexys A7 100T or equivalent.

## Modules
### `Snake_logic.v` : Contains the main logic of the Snake Game , its the main file and also contains the start screen of the game.
### `debouncer_delayed.v` : Top-level module that implements a button debouncer using a finite state machine and a parameterized delay timer to filter out noise from mechanical button inputs.
### `debouncer_delayed_fsm.v` : Implements the finite state machine controlling the debouncing process by managing state transitions and timer reset signals based on input stability.
### `debouncing_circuit.v` : Wraps the debouncer logic and detects clean rising edges from a bouncing button input, generating a one-clock-cycle `button_raise` pulse on each press.
### `display.v` : Implements a VGA controller generating horizontal and vertical sync signals, display enable windows, and current pixel positions (`h_loc`, `v_loc`) based on standard timing parameters.
### `final_screen.v` : It contains the GAME OVER screen of the game appers when game ends either on self collison or wall colision.
### `timer_parameter.v` : Implements a generic countdown timer that asserts a `done` signal when the counter reaches a user-defined `FINAL_VALUE`. Used to create timed delays (e.g., 20ms for debouncing).
### `constraint.xdc` : Xilinx constraint file mapping I/O pins (switches, buttons, VGA, 7-segment, clock) to the Nexys A7-100T FPGA board.

## üß© Features

### üéÆ Classic Snake Gameplay
- Control a growing snake on a 2D grid.
- Collect randomly generated fruits.
- Avoid collisions with walls or the snake‚Äôs own body.

### üß† Verilog-Based Game Logic
- All control and display logic written in **pure Verilog**, demonstrating digital design and finite state machine (FSM) principles.
- Handles snake movement, collision detection, and fruit consumption.

### üé≤ Random Number Generator (RNG)
- Implements a **Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)**-based RNG in Verilog for fruit spawning.
- Ensures fruits are placed at random grid positions without overlapping the snake.

### üñ•Ô∏è VGA Display Interface
- Outputs the game frame via **VGA at 640x480 resolution**.
- Grid, snake, and fruit are rendered in different colors.
- Pixel mapping and synchronization handled in hardware.
- It uses only 5000 LUTs with 48 BRAMs(BRAms used for Start and End Screens).
